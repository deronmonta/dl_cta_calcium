class ResidualUNet3D_Segmentation(nn.Module):
    """
    Residual 3DUnet model implementation based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00120.pdf.
    Uses ExtResNetBlock instead of DoubleConv as a basic building block as well as summation joining instead
    of concatenation joining. Since the model effectively becomes a residual net, in theory it allows for deeper UNet.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): number of input channels
        out_channels (int): number of output segmentation masks;
            Note that that the of out_channels might correspond to either
            different semantic classes or to different binary segmentation mask.
            It's up to the user of the class to interpret the out_channels and
            use the proper loss criterion during training (i.e. NLLLoss (multi-class)
            or BCELoss (two-class) respectively)
        f_maps (int, tuple): number of feature maps at each level of the encoder; if it's an integer the number
            of feature maps is given by the geometric progression: f_maps ^ k, k=1,2,3,4,5
        final_sigmoid (bool): if True apply element-wise nn.Sigmoid after the
            final 1x1 convolution, otherwise apply nn.Softmax. MUST be True if nn.BCELoss (two-class) is used
            to train the model. MUST be False if nn.CrossEntropyLoss (multi-class) is used to train the model.
        conv_layer_order (string): determines the order of layers
            in `SingleConv` module. e.g. 'crg' stands for Conv3d+ReLU+GroupNorm3d.
            See `SingleConv` for more info
        init_channel_number (int): number of feature maps in the first conv layer of the encoder; default: 64
        num_groups (int): number of groups for the GroupNorm
